Deep Learning Introduction

1. Deep learning is defines about to working on complex neural networks. This topic is subset of the Machine Learning.

 Types of Layers in Deep Learning

1. Input Layer : Recievces raw data of the machine 
2. Hidden Layer: Performs the computation in the hidden layer which is process the data.
3. Out Layer:  Provide the final output and prediction on classification.

Activation functions in Deeep Learning :

1. Relu : 
Rectified Linear Unit : which is used to the hidden layers to show the data in the gradients of the dta in which is simply used to speed up during the training of the data.
2. sigmoid :
map the values binary (0 and 1 in the layer ).
3. softmax :
cover the raw data in to (score) convert into the probability on the given data.  

Back propogration and optimisation :

In this propogration step we use some of the example :- mse(means standard error), cross entropy step: which are optimises the data.
